**Choose one of the poems and discuss how the poet addresses the topic of "coming of age."**

This poem talks about the who the real victim of divorce are. This poem is written in the perspective of a child caught in between divorcing parents. The kids side with their mother, and the family kicks out the father. They are glad when he is fired, and "tickled" when they think of him losing his office, and suits. This was all fueled by their mother's teachings. The narrator said,

> She had taught us to
> take it, to hate you and take it until we pricked with her for your annihilation, Father. 

The narrator realizes that their father has nothing left. He saw homeless people and wondered who took their lives away from them and realized that he or she had contributed to ruining his/her father's life. This is a very important coming of age moment because the narrator learns that his/her actions greatly impacted someone else's life.
